# Lenzo-pe

I'm Lenzo-pe and I'm working as a slaver of mylself to help with some projects.  
I've been learning a lot of things and a im becoming good at:
* C Programing
	* DataStructure
	* Algorithm
	* Logic

One of my favorite funcitions is `ft_strclen(char *str, int c)`
Works in that way:
```c
size_t	ft_strclen(char *str, int c)
{
	size_t	i;

	i = 0;
	while (str[i] && str[i] != c)
		i++;
	return (0);
}
```
